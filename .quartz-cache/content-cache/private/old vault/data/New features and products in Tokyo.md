> ntelligent Search for CMDB in

>              
>            
>              Use Intelligent Search for the CMDB in the
>                  CMDB Workspace, instead of CMDB Search, to construct search strings using
>                everyday natural query language (NLQ). Intelligent
>                Search queries can span multiple CMDB classes
>                and involve many CIs that are connected by different relationships. Create custom
>                synonyms and Implicit CMDB Relationships to
>                fine-tune the search to your environment.
>              Intelligent Search parses the NLQ query as you type
>                and provides a dynamic list of relevant suggestions that match single words or part
>                phrases in your query. Then, Intelligent Search resolves any ambiguities in table
>                names or relationship types and converts your natural language search string into a
>                valid CMDB query that you can run. Complex
>                search strings open fully constructed on a canvas of CMDB Query Builder where you can continue and
>                refine or run the query.
>              Intelligent Search for CMDB functionality is
>                integrated with CMDB Query Builder, letting you
>                find CIs and their relationships using basic NLQ
>                functions. The CMDB query is constructed
>                dynamically as you type into a search field.

> CI attestation in CMDB
>                Workspace
>            
>              Verify the existence of actual IT infrastructure and applications that you own,
>                systematically and in bulk. As CIs are continuously ingested into the CMDB from various data sources, ensure the
>                integrity of the CMDB by removing any stale CIs
>                that are associated with IT infrastructure or applications that no longer exist.
>              Use the CMDB Data Manager to create an
>                Attestation policy, specifying CIs that need to be attested and the attestation
>                frequency. Assign attestation tasks to users that are familiar with or that manage
>                the CIs, and who can attest or reject the IT infrastructure or applications that
>                those CIs represent. Rejected CIs that are no longer needed can then be retired,
>                archived, or deleted.
>              Users can see their assigned attestation tasks in the Attestation view when they
>                log in to the CMDB Workspace, and review and
>                process those attestation tasks.

> Cascade-retire dependent
>                CIs
>            
>              When dependent CIs management is enabled, the system manages dependent CIs whenever
>                CIs are deleted or archived, and now, also when CIs are retired. When a CI is
>                retired, the system checks all the relationship records for that CI. For any
>                relationship that is with a dependent CI, the system adds the dependent CI to the
>                [cmdb_dependent_ci_ledger] table and sets the CI as ready to retire.
>              The system then generates a CMDB Data Manager
>                retire policy for the set of dependent CIs and leverages the Data Manager to manage
>                the review the retirement process.

>              Apply processes of dependent CIs management to orphan dependent CIs from previous
>                delete or archive operations. When enabling dependent CIs management,
>                cascade-cleanup operations apply only from when the feature is enabled. You can
>                improve the overall performance and data integrity of the CMDB by applying the same cascade-cleanup
>                operations to orphan dependent CIs that existed in the CMDB before the feature was enabled.
>              Enable dependent CIs management to ensure future cascade-cleanup of any orphan
>                dependent CIs and also activate the Cleanup Orphan CIs scheduled job to perform a
>                one-time cascade-cleanup of dependent CIs that were previously orphaned.
