## Page Notes
## Highlights
- 1. What is the official definition of a demand? What is the definition of an enhancement? How do they differ? Demand - Our customer's desire and willingness to pay for and/or use a product or service. Demand management is a strategic request from the business to IT and automates the steps in the investment decision process. Enhancement - An enhancement is a noteworthy improvement to the product as part of a new version of it. The term is also sometimes used to distinguish an improvement (enhancement) of some existing product capability from a totally new capability. Differ - A demand is where the noteworthy improvement is prioritized against everything else.  In our world, we have defined an enhancement that is less than 40 hours.  If the demand is more than 40 hours, we handle the request as a project.  I have attached a Visio that was from the SN PPM training and made some changes for our environment. — [Updated on 2019-11-21 19:07:00](https://hyp.is/AZuWwgy8EeqFC3Ovizr-Mg/community.servicenow.com/community?id=community_question&sys_id=914c11ab1bb084507a5933f2cd4bcb7c&anchor=answer_fb759e48db098418feb1a851ca961947&view_source=searchResult) — Group: #CloudPires
