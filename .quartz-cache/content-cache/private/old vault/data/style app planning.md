**plan outfits** 

-   why?

-   outfit diversity 
-   reduce risk of repeat wears 

**fit diary** 

**item lifecycle log** 

-   why?

-   learn brand attributes 

-   quality 
-   fit

-   what? - what would I be logging

-   last time worn (reference to fit diary)

-   considerations

-   before I can log notes for an item, the item has to be inserted somewhere
