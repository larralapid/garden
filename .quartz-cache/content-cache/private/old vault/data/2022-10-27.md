suddenly ui builder has just clicked. i think what helped is just clicking around trying to figure things out on my own instead of reading the product docs first. whenever i start reading documentation beore clicking around in the tool i'm trying to figure out, i just end up spinning my wheels #servicenow [servicenow] #epiphany #til 

while working on [[configurable workpace]] learned a good amount about using templates for pages. and how to configure properties. the documentation is actually pretty helpful #servicenow
