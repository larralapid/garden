## Highlights
- In fact, I have take a look in the UI Page "notification_preferences" and found the used field : notification_filter .Now, we change the value of the notification_filter field in our custom widget and it works fine.if notification_filter = '', the user receives the email notification.if notification_filter = 'c1bfa4040a0a0b8b001eeb0f3f5ee961', the user doesn't receive the email notification. — [Updated on 2022-10-17 12:26:28](https://hyp.is/c38jpk44Ee22hFOvvo4qZw/www.servicenow.com/community/developer-forum/how-to-manage-subscriptions-to-notifications-in-service-portal/m-p/1789257) — Group: #Public
