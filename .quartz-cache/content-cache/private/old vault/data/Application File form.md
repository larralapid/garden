## Highlights
- Note: You may find it useful to manually add an Owned By (owned_by) field to this form. It indicates, for each application, who in IT owns the application and is responsible for maintaining information about it. The Data Certification function uses this field to send certification tasks every quarter, or at any time interval that is configured. You can assign certification tasks to other users, but using this field limits configuration effort.
