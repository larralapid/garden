- **Are there any specific aspects of the SAML 2.0 integration that you would like to assess or need help with?**: the transform map (i believe this was auto generated and i'm not sure if i even need it)
- **Do you need information on how to perform a test connection, update any properties, or need details on user provisioning?**: yes, the documentation should include how to test connection. it should also include details of how we have user provisioning set up (it may be way different than how most instances do it because there is a custom table extended from sys_user called AD active dormant users.)
- **Are there any specific attributes, connections, or server configurations that need a closer look or modification in your LDAP integration?**: the transform maps
- **Do you want to explore options for SSL, tweaking connection timeouts, or any other particular settings?**: maybe troubleshooting when ldap goes does down or midserver issues
