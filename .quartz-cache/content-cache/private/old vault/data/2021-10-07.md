[[Einstein Business Service Source]] #data-source
- import est table name: u_business_applications (loads data feeds it looks like)
- transform map points to the business application table 

Transform Einstein CI except servers 
- source: u_einstein_ci_details --> target: cmdb_ci 
- includes data feeds 

i'm not sure what the transform map to business application table is for. i dont think this pairs with [[Einstein Business Service Source]]
