Possible approaches:  
- Add mailboxes directly in ServiceNow so that outgoing mail can come from that mailbox instead of individual agent. This way eliminates accidental oversight if email is missed by agent. Everyone can access this mailbox. No additional configuration or customization required for making sure the reply-to address is the servicenow instance address (if the sender is set to agent's email address) 

- When outbound mail is sent from instance, the sender is currently being autopopulated with logged in user instead of servicenow instance email address. There is also a "reply-to," find whatever is populating this and add customization to set it to always be servicenow instance address.

Something to keep in mind: The reply-to might need to be the servicenow instance email address so that the watermark is processed and associated with the correct task record. OR the system property that contains value of what the watermark processing rules is looking for in the subect needs updated. Need to test behavior if the system property (which is in global scope) is dupicated in court ops scope?  will it honor the court ops property instead of the global one?
