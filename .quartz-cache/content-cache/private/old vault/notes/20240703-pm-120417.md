To structure your quote to reflect the anticipated 40 hours of work and the fixed price of $4,440, you should clearly outline the scope of work covered by the fixed price and specify the terms for any work beyond that scope. Hereâ€™s an ideal structure for the quote:

1. **Introduction/Summary**: 
   - Start with a brief explanation of the project scope and objectives.
   - Mention the total fixed price and the rationale behind it, including the estimated hours.

2. **Detailed Scope of Work**:
   - List all tasks and deliverables included within the fixed price.
   - Specify any assumptions or conditions this fixed price is based on (e.g., client providing certain resources or access).

3. **Fixed Price Breakdown**:
   - List the fixed price of $4,440.
   - Outline the equivalent hourly rate ($110/hour) for the sake of transparency.
   - Highlight that this rate is hypothetical for the fixed price calculation only, and actual billing will be on a fixed price basis for the defined scope.

4. **Hourly Rate for Additional Work**:
   - Clearly state that any additional work outside the scope will be billed at the hourly rate of $110.
   - Define how this additional work would be approved (e.g., new mini SoWs, change orders).

5. **Payment Schedule**:
   - Define how payments should be made (e.g., 50% upfront, 50% upon completion).
   - Include any milestones if payments are tied to them.

6. **Terms and Conditions**:
   - Include standard terms and conditions, such as payment terms, project timeline, and any guarantees/warranties.

7. **Sign-off**:
   - Make sure there's space for both parties to sign the quote, signifying agreement to the terms.

Here's an example of how to display this information in the quote:
