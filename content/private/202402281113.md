hi bard. I own a technical solutions consulting company. I just had a scoping session today with a client, Heidelberg. He agreed to sign an SOW. I told him I would send him a quote (this is for servicenow work by the way). 12 hours were discussed for Service catalog enhancements and 5 hours for development transition post handling support. I don't have a template for a quote. We discussed I will charge $110 per hour. I don't know how to put this together. Do I need an objective? Or a summary? Also, this is 1 senior developer for this rate. HELP!   to the best of your ability, can you please write it for me? my company is called somastack and the address is 1455 dalton ave, cincinnati oh 45214. my name is larra lapid. the client is Heidelberg distributing co. my contact info is 513-514-9041 and my email address is larra@somastack.com. After I send the quote? do I need to write a statement of work as well? I have a bank account with novo. how will they pay me and should I include this? or should that be included in the invoice that I will send them? please write it in markdown
