> The homepage feature is deprecated. If the Next Experience UI is enabled, upgrading
&gt;            customers can view existing homepages but cannot create homepages or edit existing
&gt;            homepages.
&gt;          The Dashboard Builder for workspaces has been removed. The new in-line editor replaces
&gt;            it for most use cases. You can create and edit more technical dashboards in the UI Builder, in the special Advanced Dashboards workspace Navigate to WorkspacesÂ &gt; Advanced Dashboards Workspace. Dashboards previously built with the Dashboard Builder are automatically
&gt;            transferred to this workspace. For more information, see the Platform Analytics Workspace release notes.

&gt;              inline and technical dashboard editors replace these components. For instances
&gt;              upgrading to Tokyo, the following changes happen:
&gt;                All the Dashboards that were built with the Dashboard Viewport component are
&gt;                  migrated to the &quot;Advanced Dashboard&quot; experience.
&gt;                All the &quot;Advanced Dashboards&quot; are editable with the Technical editor, which is
&gt;                  integrated with the UI Builder. These dashboards are visible from the runtime from
&gt;                  the Dashboard page. For more information, see Create a dashboard with the
&gt;                    Technical editor.
&gt;                All pages with the Dashboard viewport UIB component are automatically updated to
&gt;                  have the new Dashboard inline editor instead. For more information, see Create a dashboard with the
&gt;                    In-line editor.
