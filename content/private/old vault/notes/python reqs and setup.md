Wait wtf is setup.py and what's the difference between it and requirements.txt 

# answer
In the Python ecosystem, `setup.py` and `requirements.txt` serve different purposes in the context of package management and distribution. Let me clarify how each of them is used:

### `setup.py`

- **Purpose**: It's a build script for setuptools. It contains metadata about your package such as the name, version, and description, along with the dependencies needed to run the package. It is essentially used when you want to package and distribute your Python code.

- **Features**:
  - You can specify package dependencies along with their versions.
  - Allows for more granularity by defining extras_require, where you can specify optional dependencies.
  - Supports installation of packages directly from a git repository, or even a local filesystem.
  - Useful for creating distributable Python packages (wheels or source distributions) that can be uploaded to PyPI.

- **Example Structure**:
  ```python
  from setuptools import setup, find_packages

  setup(
      name='your_package',
      version='0.1.0',
      packages=find_packages(),
      install_requires=[
          'numpy',
          'pandas',
      ],
      extras_require={
          'dev': ['pytest', 'sphinx']
      }
  )
  ```

### `requirements.txt`

- **Purpose**: This is used primarily to define fixed versions of dependencies for the development environment. It's used to ensure that all developers are working with the same versions of libraries, which helps in avoiding "it works on my machine" syndrome.

- **Features**:
  - Lists libraries and versions that are required to run the application.
  - Mainly used in conjunction with virtual environments like `venv` or `virtualenv`.
  - Typically used by build systems and installation tools like `pip` to ensure the necessary packages are installed.
  - Does not contain metadata about your package and cannot be used alone to distribute your package.

- **Example Structure**:
  ```plaintext
  numpy==1.18.5
  pandas==1.0.5
  ```

### Key Differences:

- **Meta vs. List**: `setup.py` is a build script containing package metadata and can manage complex dependencies, while `requirements.txt` is a flat list of packages and versions.
- **Flexibility vs. Fixed Versions**: `setup.py` can allow more flexible package versions e.g., `package>=1.0.0`, whereas `requirements.txt` defines fixed versions e.g., `package==1.0.0`.
- **Distribution vs. Development**: `setup.py` is used for distributing packages, whereas `requirements.txt` is more for creating a consistent development environment.
- **Support for Editable Installs**: `setup.py` supports editable installs with `pip install -e .`, which is great for local development, allowing changes in source code without the need to reinstall the package.

In a development side project, you might use both `setup.py` when you want to package your code for distribution, and `requirements.txt` when you just want to document the exact environment needed to run the project.
