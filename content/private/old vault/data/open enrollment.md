how much do i  think i spend on out of pocket costs a year ? = *$2400*
- adderall = 360
- psychiatry = 960 
- therapy = 1080

## 2022 health insurance monthly costs
$4000 deductible
| equifax paid | i paid | 
| ------------ | ------ |
| $177.53      | $47.42 |

*TOTAL = 2695.8*

vyvanse is still not covered by insurance. nor is adhd medication in general. so i guess i'll keep doing the high premium health insurance
