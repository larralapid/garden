was going to go this route: 
- use IFTTT to make ret call to jira and then create dropbox text file with the sprint details so that alex can read from it 
- idk how to string action outputs together into later actions in the workfow rn 

so [[data/notes/alfred_start sprint|instead]]  im going to create an [[alfred]] automation that i will manually trigger to declare that i have committed to the start of the sprint
