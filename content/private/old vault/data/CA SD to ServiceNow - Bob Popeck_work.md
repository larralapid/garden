Evening, 

After reviewing the latest needs of Health Care, both from a service and security standpoint, and deeper discussions with Patient Ping staff, it is clear to me that Health Care will need to move into JIRA Service Desk. 

Retail is already there, Patient Ping, and the lift for moving Appriss Health Care will not be difficult as they have a smaller footprint in Request, Incidents, Change and Problem.   I will be reaching out Laura Newkirk about this decision to discuss how we plan and execute move them. 

I will have us reach for a quote for moving Appriss Health to JIRA SD.  Insights will continue its path in to Service Now.   As always don’t be afraid to ask questions. 

Thank you
