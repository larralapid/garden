learning xcode
following the dateplanner sample app tutorial provided by apple developer website
jk stopped following the dateplanner tutorial and moved my vocus to https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/app-dev-training/creating-a-list-view because it seems to be a more beginner friendly tutorial
	what i did:
		1. created new app 
			1. storyboard
			2. left the core data host in cloudkit checkboxes unchecked 
		2. press the play button at the top left and it pops open another window that simulates the iphone screen 
		3. go to the Main storyboard and deleted the view controller thats just there by default. 
			1. add collection view controller from the library 
			2. deleted the cell template 
			3. select the entire collection view controller scene --> attributes inspector --> view controller --> is initial view controller = true
		4. created a new group called models under the today folder 
		5. control-click models group --> add new file --> window pops up to choose a template for the new file 
			1. added structure with variables 
			2. added some if "compilation directive" for debugging; looks at a debug flag and if its true then it runs whatever is inside the if statement 
			3. added sample data in the if statement 
		6. navigated to the view controller storyboard and udpated the class name and the superclass
