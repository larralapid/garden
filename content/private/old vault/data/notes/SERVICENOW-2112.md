> Subscription life cycle
> 
> A typical subscription life cycle is as follows:
> 
> 1. Purchase new subscriptions from the ServiceNow Store.
> 2. After your subscriptions are delivered to your production instance, view them in Subscription Management. See [View your subscriptions](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/utah-platform-administration/page/administer/subscription-management/task/view-purchased-subscriptions.html "Use the Subscription Overview module to view the subscriptions that your organization has purchased.").
> 3. Make sure that your users have access to the subscriptions they need. See [Managing your users](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/utah-platform-administration/page/administer/subscription-management/concept/allocating-users.html "Use Subscription Management to monitor and manage your users and their licenses. Ensure that users have access to the correct applications and monitor over-allocation to stay within compliance.").
> 4. If your subscriptions come with custom table entitlements, map your custom tables to a subscription. If you create custom applications, map them to a subscription as well. To learn more about custom applications and tables, see [Managing your custom applications and tables](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/utah-platform-administration/page/administer/subscription-management/concept/allocating-custom-tables-subscr-apps.html "Subscription Management helps you manage and track custom applications and custom tables on your instances.").
> 5. Monitor and adjust the resources of your subscriptions to ensure you are within compliance. Watch for:
>     
>     - overallocation of users on a subscription
>     - out-of-policy users
>     - unmapped custom applications and tables
>     
>     - [ ] To learn more about monitoring your compliance, see [Managing your subscription compliance](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/utah-platform-administration/page/administer/subscription-management/concept/monitoring-subscription-allocation.html "With Subscription Management, you can review and monitor your subscription compliance. By monitoring the allocation of users, applications, and tables, you can make better decisions about your subscription purchases and stay within compliance.")
> 6. Review the activity of your subscriptions. Look for:
>     
>     - usage patterns over time
>     - application popularity
>     - custom table usage
>     
>     - [ ] To learn about reviewing subscription activity, see [View subscription history reports](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/utah-platform-administration/page/administer/subscription-management/task/view-subscription-history.html "View a subscription's history report to see subscription status, dates, and trend information.") and [View user subscription history](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/utah-platform-administration/page/administer/subscription-management/task/view-user-subscription-history.html "View a history of the users allocated to a subscription.").
> 7. Consider your subscription usage to help you make informed decisions on future purchases.
