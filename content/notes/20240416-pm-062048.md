trying to think of different solutions/approaches
- thing im trying to figure out
	- FaceTime video:
		- iPhone 
	- FaceTime audio
		- output 
			- probably not Mac because the music I'm listening to might be accidentally interrupted by detecting what it thinks is talking on the other line and it'll just be annoying
		- input (mic)
	- Spotify output 
		- Mac 
	- and listening to music on spotify 
		- on my Mac,
	- I want the person I am FaceTiming 
		- not to be able to hear the music I am listening to. 
			- Kinda like how it works if the apps were active on the same device. 

I think this might be done in midi
