spent some time today evaluating accounting software to use. 

i use [[zoho|zoho invoice]] for:
- quote generation 
- masterfile 
- invoicing 
- stripe payment (integrated with zoho)

novo for banking 

was using wave but forgot about the $99 annual fee. i signed up for a bunch of stuff i thought i needed last year when i had fuck you money. i never used wave the entire past year i had it. 

activities i don't have a tool to perform them in (or process not yet thought through and implemented)
- forecasting 
- expense tracking 
- tax stuff? idk much about business taxes yet. 
- contract management 
- time tracking
