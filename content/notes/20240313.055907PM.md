disabled the obsidian git plugin because concerned about
- noticed a duplicate note bug happening a few days ago but hasn't happened since then. idk what did it. 
- obsidian settings 
- idk the potential risks and conflicts having both obsidian sync turned on while using the git plugin. also this vault started as a folder on my desktop which is synced to icloud. 

what led to this decision? 
- been trying to figure out what my process will be for moving notes from noteplan to obsidian. 
- [ ] current noteplan process 
	- daily notes 
		- activity log 
		- some fleeting thoughts 
		- these get processed within a week of the daily note date 
	- other notes that i imported that came from an old obsidian vault.
