i fucked up my right thumb from scrolling too much and that fucked me up mentally and made me start wanting to take my screen time awareness more seriously. 

Here's an [[apple shortcut]] that runs upon opening instagram. It will tell me how long it has been since i last opened [[instagram]] and prompts me to confirm whether or not to proceed. If i select no, it'll close instagram and go to the home screen. if i select yes, it will capture the current timestamp and log it to datajar (this timestamp will be used in the "last time since opened" calculation the next time the shortcut runs)
