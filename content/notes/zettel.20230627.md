PROMPT

In the KPI composer UI, the next tab is "dashboard visualization". I am going to create a tab called "Last Month (EOM)" to display widgets derived from what has been documented in the analysis phase.  

This tab is intended to be a more exciting enhanced version of an existing dashboard tab that i am using for reference. this existing dashboard tab only contains reports. In the dashboard that i'm referencing, it was not built to its fullest potential in the most aesthetically streamlined way. For example, there were two "EOM" tabs. One for Tier 1 and one for Tier 2 (i am assuming this is a solution built to filter for assignment group). 

Using Tier 2 EOM, this tab has 4 report widgets and the following are what they are titled
- opened tier 2 tickets research (last month)
- opened tier 2 tickets resync (last month)
- testing times for tier 2 research (opened last month)
- testing times for tier 2 resync (opened last month)

My conclusions drawn from title assumptions
- There is a need to filter by tier which is assignment group
	- count of how many open per category
- Not sure what "testing times" is. I'd like to replace these with 1 or more visualizations depicting the count tickets opened broken down by assignment group and whether it's research or resync. 
	- Measure time spent active 
	- measure time spent in each assignment group 

In kpi composer's dashboard visualization phase, I have created a new tab and set the title. I am being prompted to specify the number of canvases in the row details. What number of canvases should i set this tab up to have?
