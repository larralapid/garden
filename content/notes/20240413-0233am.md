i think i used this so that i could use #smart bulbs that weren't compatible with apple home that i set up with [[alexa]]. i wanted to be able to ask both alexa and [[siri]] to automate my lights. 

if i remember correctly, voicemonkey integrated with [[ifttt]] which allowed me to have light switch button widgets and use those to toggle the lights quickly (as opposed to going into the alex app). 

idr if i also tied it to a siri shortcut but probably.
