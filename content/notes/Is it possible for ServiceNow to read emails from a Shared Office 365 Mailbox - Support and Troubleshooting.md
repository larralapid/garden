## Page Notes
## Highlights
- In many cases, your company may wish to provide an address such as support@company.com and set this as a shared mailbox so that both support teams and your instance read emails from this mailbox. This is NOT recommended by both Microsoft and ServiceNow. — [Updated on 2022-06-03 17:38:37](https://hyp.is/hwD3iOOFEeyV2a9o-ark_Q/support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0953296) — Group: #Public

- "ServiceNow instances assume exclusive use of the IMAP mailbox. The instance deletes mail from the server after reading. Therefore, using a mailbox that is shared among different services and/or users is not recommended. Each service or user will interfere with the instance’s mail operations.” — [Updated on 2022-06-03 17:40:00](https://hyp.is/uF3eIuOFEeyppRMqvYwGGg/support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0953296) — Group: #Public
