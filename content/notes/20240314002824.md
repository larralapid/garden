#question using [[noteplan]] and [[obsidian]] in my [[Ecosystem]] flow
- what kind of stuff goes in which? 
	- [[noteplan]] 
		- activity log 
		- decisions made 
		- active projects 
		- out of scope
			- zettels and fleeting thoughts 
			- consumption lists (reading list, to watch list)
			- irrelevant research 
	- [[obsidian]]
		- research 
		- zettels 
		- incomplete thoughts 
		- #til stuff 
		- #dicking-around activity logs
