[[noteplan]] daily note improved process #idea

![[assets/Pasted image 20240415011456.png]]

### The Idea
- when i'm processing past daily notes, move whatever was completed to the appropriate related note so that it is removed from the body of the daily note 
- this is good because this will reduce the size of my noteplan notes
- just more organized this way 
- if i ever wanna see what i did for a particular day, i can see what was done like each task for each project
