- **Time and Materials (T&M)**: This type of contract involves billing the client for the actual work hours at a set hourly rate, as well as any additional materials or services used.
    
- **Fixed-Price (FP)**: A fixed-price contract sets a total price for all activities in the scope of work. This type may be preferred when both parties agree on a well-defined scope and schedule.
    
- **Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF)**: Under this agreement, the contractor is reimbursed for approved costs plus a fixed fee, often expressed as a percentage of the initial estimated project costs.
    
- **Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF)**: Similar to CPFF, CPIF contracts provide a fee above cost. However, this additional fee is contingent upon meeting certain performance objectives.
