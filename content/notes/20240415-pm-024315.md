opening up the browser and going to chat.openai.com takes too long. the seconds saved do add up. 

Showing myself grace is something i'm learning. On days that weren't a 200% productivity day, i'd tell myself i was unproductive, i should have done this or that, and just completely beat myself up about it .

After getting fired from Equifax last september, i really leaned into the "give myself grace" thing. I let myself take a break from work completely. at the time, somastack had already been a company for a year. 

After getting fired, initially i felt like i should immediately start going 500% at growing my new consultancy. The desire to want to lead a successful company was there. But the motivation to commit to following through with tasks wasn't. little to no motivation to even begin a task. i was scared to start. 

something i'm still working on, getting to a level of self discipline where i notice there's a feeling of dread associated with a to do list item and i have the courage to overcome the anxiety (not doing the task is really just the fear of still feeling the dread/discomfort while i'm doing the task. like i'm gonna feel the same feelings as the dread felt before i've even started the task). I can't remember a time i dreaded a task then actually started doing the task and the negative feeling getting worse. Usually when i really have gotten myself to start working on a task, i'll get 2-5 minutes into it and suddenly dread goes away, i've completely forgotten i even was being a little bitch about it.

anyway, i'm rambling. basically what i'm trying to say is that i'm letting myself follow my curiosities because play is okay. sometimes i'll be working on something and just get annoyed with a feature that might be lacking in a tool i'm using or i realize that there's a solution for an enhanced way to do it. 

Now, I let myself go ahead and build utilities/workflows. Obviously i'm mindful of the level of effort and time spent on whatever it is i'm building. i let myself get distracted especially for #dick-around distractions like building stuff to improve my workflow because
- any chance to build something is an opportunity to make use of the neuroplasticity out of box feature my brain comes with. gotta keep my brain sharp. 
- future me always appreciates it 
- when i've finally completed developing whatever thing i thought will enhance my workflow, the sense of accomplishment knowing i have completed creating something through to the end.
