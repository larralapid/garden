editing the shell script. idk but it seems like maybe apple shortcuts doesn't allow shell variables. so i have to break up the script like 

```
# Navigate to the git repository
cd /Users/larra/local/garden

# Fetch latest changes from remote
git fetch

# Switch to the content branch
git checkout content

echo 
```

OKAY WAIT ACTUALLY NEW DEVELOPMENT...
it's because i was running the action as administrator
