i enabled [[templater]] recently, an [[obsidian]] extension. 
and disabled the unique note creator 

- templater is triggered on new notes 
- obsidian new note location setting: ==notes==
- when new note is created in the notes folder, it triggers the [[_settings/templates/Zettel Template|Zettel Template]] which runs a templater script to update the title 
- as i was writing in some note earlier this is what happened
	```mermaid
	graph TD;
	    A[Create link to non-existing page] --> B{Click on link};
	    B -->|Create file in notes folder| C[File is created];
	    C -->|Triggers Templater automation| D[Templater automation];
	    D -->|Updates file title| E[File title in Zettelkasten format];
	
	```

## possible solutions
- enable unique note creator
