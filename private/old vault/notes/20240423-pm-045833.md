[[notes/ServiceNow|ServiceNow]] #idea 

- pain points 
	- updates not tracked in correct update set 
	- not all devs write notes regarding what they did 
	- when reviewing update set updates, sometimes there are multple updates for 1 component 
		- example: a catalog item build 
			- all the variables 
			- all the other stuff related to the catalog item, when reviewing updates and if updates were tracked across several different update sets, its hard to identify all the ones that belong to the same catalog item 

- solution
	- use comments on sys_update_xml 
		- manual or ai 
			- manual
				- when to trigger? 
					- on insert and update set reference is your current update set
				- then what happens 
					- task is generated 
					- user is prompted to to write comments 
						- when? 
							- immediately 
							- before closing update set 
		- ai 
			- looks at versions 
			- user updates timeline 
	- might be helpful too if there were a story or requirements documented somewhere 
		- where could we put it? 
			- update set description
				- standardize 
				- we want the same level of quality each time 

- if comments were always populated before closing an update set, you could:
	- automate change notes 
	- enhanced atf 
	- troubleshooting 
		- if the business service is servicenow on an incident
	- understand the evolution of an application file
