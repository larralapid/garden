> An extra tip for those using git is to add an exception to your .gitignore for those hidden .ipynb_checkpoints directories Jupyter creates, so as not to commit checkpoint files unnecessarily to your repo.

> To get the extensions, you need to install Nbextensions. You can do this using pip and the command line. If you have Anaconda, it may be better to do this through Anaconda Prompt rather than the regular command line.
&gt;Close Jupyter Notebooks, open Anaconda Prompt, and run the following command: pip install jupyter_contrib_nbextensions &amp;&amp; jupyter contrib nbextension install.

> How to Use Magics in Jupyter
&gt;A good first step is to open a Jupyter Notebook, type %lsmagic into a cell, and run the cell. This will output a list of the available line magics and cell magics, and it will also tell you whether &quot;automagic&quot; is turned on.
&gt;
&gt;Line magics operate on a single line of a code cell
&gt;Cell magics operate on the entire code cell in which they are called

> If automagic is on, you can run a magic simply by typing it on its own line in a code cell, and running the cell. If it is off, you will need to put  % before line magics and  %%  before cell magics to use them.

> you can see the documentation for any magic by running it with a question mark, like so:
&gt;%matplotlib?
&gt;When you run the above cell in a notebook, a lengthy docstring will pop up onscreen with details about how you can use the magic.

&gt;Counts loops, measures and reports how long a code cell takes to execute.
