## Page Notes
## Highlights
- Domain separation is best for those customers who: Need to enforce absolute data segregation between business entities (data separation). Customize business process definitions and user interfaces for each domain (delegated administration). Maintain some global processes and global reporting in a single instance. Separate data between customers or sub-organizations. Have minor or moderate process differences only among customers or sub-organizations. — [Updated on 2019-03-01 14:57:41](https://hyp.is/RX4ijDxcEemtBeebenXeLg/docs.servicenow.com/bundle/london-platform-administration/page/administer/company-and-domain-separation/concept/c_DomainSeparation.html) — Group: #Public
