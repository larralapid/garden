Json npm package is tight
But jq might be cooler

Noticed something about my Spotify listening patterns
- you know ongoing monthly playlist that I clear out at the end of each month and repopulat e through out the following month?
- Well I  use the "create similar playlist" ui action today 
- Glad I did that 
- BECAUSE 
- This playlist is fucking fire. Haven't hearted so many songs in such a short listening span in so long. Or this vyvanse and dispensary weed combo is bussin 
- Did this on the 2021 playlist 

All of this leads to an idea I promise...

What if I create a discovery algorithm based on continuously creating these off one another

- virtual publicist. Or one stop shop for social media. Something where the company name "social(it)e" makes sense 



I need Alexa to get a value from a json file in dropbox. Ifttt doesn't seem to allow for returning something that Alexa can use in a eaponse
