## Page Notes
## Highlights
- Pulling retrieves all versions that have not already been pulled onto the development instance, including historical versions, and you cannot choose which versions to pull. You must resolve any collisions before proceeding with further pulls or pushes. — [Updated on 2018-11-26 19:51:08](https://hyp.is/hx4c4vHeEei3wUP0AWN74w/docs.servicenow.com/bundle/london-application-development/page/build/team-development/concept/c_PullsAndPushes.html) — Group: #CloudPires

- Pushing creates a local Update Set on the parent that is marked as complete. — [Updated on 2018-11-26 19:51:31](https://hyp.is/lNxOivHeEeiPpH_DhXs--A/docs.servicenow.com/bundle/london-application-development/page/build/team-development/concept/c_PullsAndPushes.html) — Group: #CloudPires

- Pushed versions are also tracked as local changes on the parent. Therefore, you can promote changes through your development and test hierarchy by transferring the Update Set or by pushing the local changes.  — [Updated on 2018-11-26 19:52:08](https://hyp.is/quXvnPHeEeipJSflWrHToQ/docs.servicenow.com/bundle/london-application-development/page/build/team-development/concept/c_PullsAndPushes.html) — Group: #CloudPires
