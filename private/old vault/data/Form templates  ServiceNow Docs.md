## Page Notes
## Highlights
- You can create table-level access controls to restrict template creation. When applied, a user creating a new record from a template must satisfy the save_as_template access control for every field modified by the template. — [Updated on 2019-08-27 12:08:52](https://hyp.is/9lDf_sjkEemdrxdGdFs5Cw/docs.servicenow.com/bundle/newyork-platform-administration/page/administer/form-administration/concept/c_Templates.html) — Group: #Public

- Automatic templates are always global. They do not honor the User and Group fields on the Template form. Automatic templates do not apply to records created by the system, such as those records generated by business rules, UI actions, or workflows. — [Updated on 2019-08-27 12:09:26](https://hyp.is/CrplAMjlEemZXON72DQAbA/docs.servicenow.com/bundle/newyork-platform-administration/page/administer/form-administration/concept/c_Templates.html) — Group: #Public
