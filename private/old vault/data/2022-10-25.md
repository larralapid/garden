inotifyd
inotifyd PROG FILE1[:MASK] ...

Run PROG on filesystem changes. When a filesystem event matching MASK occurs on FILEn, PROG <actual_event(s)> <FILEn> [<subfile_name>] is run. Events:

        a       File is accessed
        c       File is modified
        e       Metadata changed
        w       Writable file is closed
        0       Unwritable file is closed
        r       File is opened
        D       File is deleted
        M       File is moved
        u       Backing fs is unmounted
        o       Event queue overflowed
        x       File can't be watched anymore
If watching a directory:
        m       Subfile is moved into dir
        y       Subfile is moved out of dir
        n       Subfile is created
        d       Subfile is deleted
inotifyd waits for PROG to exit. When x event happens for all FILEs, inotifyd exits
