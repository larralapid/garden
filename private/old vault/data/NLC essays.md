An equitable and just society to me looks like a society where everyone has an equal chance to succeed and where there is social and economic mobility; Everyone would have access to quality education, healthcare, and housing. There would be no discrimination based on race, gender, sexuality, or religion. Cross-sector collaboration is important to achieving this kind of society because it allows for the sharing of resources, knowledge, and expertise. When different sectors work together, they can pool their resources and create solutions that are more comprehensive and effective.
