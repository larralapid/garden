> New Search MechanismsJavaScript for Automation now has two additional search mechanisms you can use when searching for script libraries:You can place script libraries in the Contents/Library/Script Libraries directory of any installed application bundle. This allows distribution of libraries associated with an application, or creating applications for the sole purpose of distributing libraries.Use the environment variable OSA_LIBRARY_PATH to add more locations to search for script libraries. This feature allows you to use a library without installing it in one of the standard locations. The variableâ€™s value is a colon-separated list of absolute POSIX paths, such as OSA_LIBRARY_PATH='/opt/local/Script Libraries:/usr/local/Script Libraries'.For additional details, see Creating a Library in AppleScript Language Guide.
