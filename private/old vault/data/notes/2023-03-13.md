FOCUS THIS WEEK
- POC for anna by thursday morning 
- hilly tuesday (tomorrow)
- somastack
	- see slack
- my capstone
	- ugh having second thoughts on class action settlements. like... i can choose to do anything as my capstone and i pick writing a research paper?? 
	- ok i should go back to the consultancy idea because after talking through action items with mickey today, there's actually a lot of effort that is required to make this company real. a lot of action items. realistically, i dont have the capacity.
