# Indicator Implementation Checklist 
- [ ] Use KPI composer to brainstorm and drafting PA components. (optional) 
- [ ] **Create indicator Source.** Identify the location of the data that should be captured. Check if there are any existing indicator sources that can be used before creating a new one.
- [ ] **Create the automated indicator** record and reference the indicator source in the last step. 
- [ ] **Create and associate breakdowns to indicator**. Breakdowns are similar to the "group by" function or filters. Check if there are any breakdowns that can be applied to your indicator. Otherwise, create a new one. 
- [ ] **Create a new breakdown source**. When creating a new breakdown, there must be a breakdown source to reference; similarly to the indicator source and indicator relationship. 
- [ ] **Add indicator and breakdown(s) to historical data collection job and execute**
