#### How can I create a custom avatar of myself? 

#### Any of these scenarios possible with vstitcher?
- take pic of real person wearing an outfit --> ai processing --> output the following 
	- based on video or photo, body measurements to create base avatar 
	- create 2d garment pieces 
- fabric analysis
	- different inputs potentially used for ai processing 
		- several different photos
			- different zoom 
			- different lighting 
				- maybe not needed if there is a way to identify current lighting situation 
		- video 
			- stretch test 
			- body movement
