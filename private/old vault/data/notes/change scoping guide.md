](change scoping guide)
- [x] = documented in wiki document


- [x] confirm use of oob change types
	- standard
		- pre-approved low risk changes performed often 
		- follow documented process each time 
		- example: loading software on a desktop
		- [ ] how many standard changes need to be configured? 
			- they are grouped under specific categories 
		- standard change catalog has available changes that become available through a proposal process 
		- there is a cost per standard change configured 
	- normal
		- follows complete change process
	- emergency
		- implementation needed to be done in short time span 
		- resolves an incident that is causing or will cause major impact
		- examples: hot fixes, bug fixes 
- [x] how mature is the cmdb for auto assignment? 
	- [x] populate necessary fields on ci? on parent cis? is this configured on the class level? 
- [x] is there a risk calculation method that will be used for change?
	- OOB risk calculation methods 
		- leading practice - change risk calculator (activated out of box)
		- change management - risk assessment (not activated oob, optional)
			- [x] do we need this? 
- schedule types
	- change windows 
		- [x] establish maintenance schedules
			- period of time where changes can be implemented
			- example: a schedule could be defined so that changes are only implemented on the weekends 
		- [x] how many change windows do we need? 
		- there is apparently a cost per change window. 
			- [x] find out what this means 
	- blackout windows 
		- periods of time where changes cant be implemented 
		- example: you'd create a blackout schedule for code freezes at the end of the year 
		- there is a cost per blackout window
		- [x] determine number of blackout windows to be configured 
		- [ ] is there an exception process for handling blackout window? 
			- [ ] document this 
- [ ] new change entry points 
	- [ ] from incident 
		- [ ] change is required to restore service
	- [ ] from problem
		- [ ] change is required in order to permanently resolve problem or provide work around 
			- considerations: related incidents and related problems 
	- [ ] requested through the service catalog 
	- [ ] CMDB reviews
		- [ ] review of dependency maps for potentially impacted cis and services
