difference between service mapping a d discovery 
- discovery
	- horizontal discovery of infra and apps conected to tcp/ip networks 
	- tool is provided a ip address range and a set of creds
	- discovery will scan each ip address identifying and classifhing devices or hosts it receives responses from 
	- for each discovered thing, discovery adds or updates CI to the cmdb 
	- identifies dependencies between applications 
	- does not relate anything to business services
	- approach is broad coverage 
- service mapping 
	- top down discovery 
	- maps a business service 
	- one or more entry points is provided 
	- service mapping only discovers infra and apps that support a business service and maps their relationships 
	- more precise approach 
	- once business service has been mapped service mapping does the following
		- routine rediscoveries 
		- detect changes ike addition or removal of servers in clusters 
		- updated software 
		- changed configuration files 
		- service maps created by service mapping can be used for impact analysis in incident and change management 
		- service mapping uses discovery 
		- if you wanna mointor the availability status of a business service event management is needded

business service changes
- tables we are using 
	- cmdb_ci_service
	- service_offering
- we are not using (tables introduced in rome) and csdm 4.0
	- cmdb_ci_service_business
		- extended from cmdb_ci_service
	- cmdb_ci_service_technical
	- includes identical functonality 

for service offerings, new column added for parent service classification

in tokyo, there's a bulk conversion tool https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/tokyo-it-service-management/page/product/service-portfolio-management2/task/SPM2-migrate-bulk-services.html 
	 wil keep the same ss id 

why the new tables?
- replaces service_classification 
- servicenow has recognied a need to further differentiate service CIs as SPM and CSDM applications have grown
- we should convert because everything will be retained; we are only losing out on newer SPM and CSDM features if we don't
- they're just new child tables 


ui policy & client script clean up 
- all active ui policies are same versions between prod and dev 
- [ ] look at all ui policies tht have policy action conflicts 
	- [ ] incident has conflicts

sprint planning & retro 
- shea had a meeting with equifax to discuss what all is moving from einstein to data dog 
- [ ] are we for sure going to datadog 
- [ ] should i work on data classification stuff?
- [ ] update sets
