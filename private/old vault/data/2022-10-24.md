[[Court Ops]] meeting
go live is nov 2nd   
waiting on descriptions for service offering 
parent product 
- data 
- court research 

user will choose parent product first then the specific product 

for internal users, to submit a form, they will go to service catalog and we'll create record producers based on the templates bekah has provided \

inquiry reason is main ticket on ticket types tab 

#idea complete the court ops service catalog and see if there is an api nick can use to dynamically mirror it in ops desk 

- [ ] create a form for bekah to add offerings 
- [ ] configurable workspace so that it is dynamic 
- [ ] how can court ops ticket be routed to cfc teams and cfc still use their ticket type? sync it with the court ops ticket 

what's stationary pad ? saw it in pathfinder when looking at file atteibutes 
what if we lock past daily notes?
