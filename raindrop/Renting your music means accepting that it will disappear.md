Title:: Renting your music means accepting that it will disappear
---

When I was using Apple Music I had a smart playlist that would surface music that was no longer available on the service and having to do that sums up one of the many problems with music streaming services. It&#39;s not really your collection â€” you&#39;re renting it and your collection only exists on that service. If it disappears, your collection disappears.
